The goal of emdash is to provide a deployer dashboard for an e-mission deployment.

## Installation

You can install emdash from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("asiripanich/emdash")
```

Alternatively, with Docker CLI:

    docker pull amarins/emdash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 --name emdash amarins/emdash

After that, open your favourite browser and type `localhost` or `http://0.0.0.0:80` in the URL bar to see the dashboard.

## How to use the dashboard

### Run locally

To use the dashboard you must config the port of your e-mission mongoDB in the `emdash::run_app(mongo_url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017')` command. As you can see, the default is `27017`. The easiest way to use this dashboard with your e-mission deployment is to create a SSH tunnel to the e-mission mongo on your e-mission server.

``` ssh
ssh -L {my-local-port}:localhost:{remote-server-port} username@your-server-ip-address-or-domain-name
ssh -L 27017:localhost:27017 ec2-user@123.12.12.1
```

Here is how you launch a e-mission dashboard with emdash.

``` r
library(emdash)
emdash::run_app(mongo_url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017')
```

## Loading test data

This repository contains a test mongodump with entries from the [e-mission unit test real data](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/tree/master/emission/tests/data/real_examples).

It includes background sensed data (`background/*`), analysis results (`analysis/*`) and the mode and purpose confirm objects from the master branch (`manual/mode_confirm` and `manual/purpose_confirm`).

To load the data into a local mongodb,

    $ unzip test-data/2016_jul_aug_test_trips.zip
    $ mongorestore

If you would like to load additional data, you can do so through the [e-mission server](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/#loading-test-data).

For convenience, you may use this `docker_start_test_mongodb.sh` for starting up a Docker container that will run the test database.

### Use with Docker

We provide a Dockerfile to run this dashboard. In the future we may include this as part of an e-mission docker-compose file which will be hosted on [the e-mission-docker github repo](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docker).

Be warned that the emdash Docker image is quite large, around 2.8 GB, and take a while to build. You can use pull from [the emdash docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/amarins/emdash) and skip the wait!

## How to customise the dashboard

First you need to know [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). I tried to modularise each component as much as possible so that the dashboard is easy to be customised. Any advices to improve the dashboard are welcomed. :)

### Customise query functions

See `R/utils_query_database.R`.

The functions in this script are for querying data from the e-mission mongoDB database.

### Customise data

See `R/utils_tidy_data.R`.

The functions in this script are for cleansing and transforming data queried using the functions in `R/utils_query_database.R`.
