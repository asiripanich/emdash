The goal of emdash is to provide a deployer dashboard for an e-mission deployment.

The dashboard is structured as follow:

- Dashboard
  - Value boxes
    - Number of users (+ daily)
    - Number of active users today
    - Number of trips (+ daily)
    - Time since first user
  - Plots
    - Sign ups
    - Trips
    - Branch
    - Platform

- Tables
  - Interactive plot (linked with the tables)
  - Tables (downloadable in various formats from the UI)
    - Participants
    - Trips

- Maps
    - Trips (with a data filter on the left side)

## Installation

You can install emdash from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("asiripanich/emdash")
```

## WARNING!

This package has been tested only on the following e-mission-phone branches: `rciti1`, `rciti2`, and `rciti3`. There are query functions that only work on those branches hence it is likely that the dashboard will crash if you use other branches. I will find time to generalise the dashboard or at least make it work with e-mission-phone's `master` branch in September. However, it shouldn't be hard to modify this dashboard specific to your e-mission deployment, granted that you know R and Shiny. 

## How to use the dashboard

### Run locally 

To use the dashboard you must config the port of your e-mission mongoDB in the `emdash::run_app(mongo_url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017')` command. As you can see, the default is `27017`. The easiest way to use this dashboard with your e-mission deployment is to create a SSH tunnel to the e-mission mongo on your e-mission server. 

``` ssh
ssh -L {my-local-port}:localhost:{remote-server-port} username@your-server-ip-address-or-domain-name
ssh -L 27017:localhost:27017 ec2-user@123.12.12.1
```

Here is how you launch a e-mission dashboard with emdash.

``` r
library(emdash)
emdash::run_app(mongo_url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017')
```

### Use with Docker

We provide a Dockerfile to run this dashboard. In the future we may include this as part of an e-mission docker-compose file which will be hosted on [the e-mission-docker github repo](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docker).

Be warned that the emdash Docker image is quite large, around 2.8 GB, and take a while to build.

## How to customise the dashboard

First you need to know [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). I tried to modularise each component as much as possible so that the dashboard is easy to be customised. Any advices to improve the dashboard are welcomed. :)

### Customise query functions

See `R/utils_query_database.R`.

The functions in this script are for querying data from the e-mission mongoDB database.

### Customise data

See `R/utils_tidy_data.R`.

The functions in this script are for cleansing and transforming data queried using the functions in `R/utils_query_database.R`.
